# Tailwind CSS Dynamic Class Background Color Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where the background color is not applied correctly when using a dynamic class name.  The issue seems to be related to how Tailwind processes classes when they are assigned dynamically, rather than being statically defined in the HTML.  The bug is difficult to consistently reproduce, appearing only under certain circumstances.

## How to Reproduce

Follow the steps below to attempt to reproduce the bug:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application (instructions may vary depending on your setup).
4. Observe the behavior of the element with the dynamically assigned class.  The background color may or may not apply correctly depending on various conditions (exact conditions are still under investigation).

## Solution

A workaround has been implemented in `bugSolution.js` which resolves the issue by leveraging the `classNames` library to create a more reliable class assignment approach.
